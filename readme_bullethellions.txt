Gameplay
^^^^^^^^

Bullet Hellions is a local two-player versus bullet-hell shooter.

Each player has three attack types: Light, Medium and Strong.

Players also have an ability to "focus", which slows movement, and allows for the usage of more accurate alternate attacks.

A life is lost if the centre of a player is hit by one of their opponent's bullets. This point is marked by the hand at the centre of their body.

If a player loses a life, they will be returned to the centre of their half, and will be invulnerable for a short time. Attacking will cancel this invulnerability.

Input Device
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This game was designed for XBOX 360 gamepads, but basic keyboard support is also available.

If your controller doesn't work, you could try using a program which makes it behave like a 360 pad, such as SCP Driver if you're using a DualShock 3.
Otherwise, you could try a program like JoyToKey or xPadder to map your controllers to keyboard inputs.

If you do use a keyboard, you may have issues with pressing multiple keys at once if it doesn't support n-key rollover.

The keyboard control scheme is a bit cramped, but this is to allow for laptop support. 
Sorry in advance if your non-English keyboard doesn't work, gamepads are the intended input method, and rebindable keys would have taken too long to implement. 
You could try changing your keyboard's layout to English in software if this is a problem.
